## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores **aircraft incident data** through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **feature engineering** using Python.  
The goal was to uncover key insights, patterns, and risk factors associated with aircraft incidents — while improving data quality and preparing the dataset for further modeling.

It was developed as part of a **Data Science program**, focusing on applying Python-based data analysis techniques in a real-world aviation safety context.

## 🧩 Objectives
- Conduct data cleaning and wrangling on raw aircraft incident data.  
- Handle **missing values**, **outliers**, and **data inconsistencies**.  
- Explore key **statistical patterns and trends** in the dataset.  
- Perform **feature engineering** to enhance predictive modeling potential.  
- Visualize insights with clear and informative charts.
